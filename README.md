Created principle with [python3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) e various library like [SpeechRecognition ](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)  and [TTS library](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) 

Dant3 is a virtual assistant like Alexa or Google Home but is integrated with an AI (GPT-3.5 turbo).The project is focused on the Ai/virtual assistant, but the idea is the evolve the project in a second part, which consists of a multi-platform app created with Dart and Flask, allowing the customisation of the virtual assistant


## Key Features
You can ask lots of questions at Dant3, like us:
- The time ⏲️
- The wheather 🌧️
- The last news 🗞️
- Change the volume 🔉
- The temperature 🌡️
- The days of the week 📆
- Interact with the domotic (only merros device) 💡
- Timer 🔂
- and ask **whatever you want** like: Dant3 explain quantum mathematics 🤖

## Installing

1. The first part of the installation is to download all the files from the repository
2. After that, open a terminal to the directory and run  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. when/if the installation is go done, just run the file run.bat in the terminal and use the command `run.bat` on Windows or `./run` on Linux/MacOS  and the program will start

## How to use
> Simply run the file bat/bash, it depends on your OS  and give the command o ask a question and the bot will answer in a short time 📃

## IMPORTANT!!
The project is very young and is in alpha, indeed missing a good code, there are a lot of bugs or problem and the AI working principle in Italian expect for the part of AI also the assistant is personalize only via code (for now).

## Future idea/goal for this project

> Is to create a multi-platform application with Dart and Flask to give the possibility to modify ALL (Word activation, position for weather and news, configure the domotic, etc..) 👾
